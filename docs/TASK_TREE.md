# Task-Tree Workflow

This document defines the repo-local task-tree workflow. A step-by-step setup guide is in
[TASK_TREE_README.md](TASK_TREE_README.md). Individual trees live under
[`tasks/`](tasks/); the leaf template is [`tasks/TEMPLATE.md`](tasks/TEMPLATE.md).

## Purpose

Use a task tree when a top-level task is too broad to finish safely as one signoff-quality
slice, or when it is expected to discover subtasks over time. The tree owns the recursive
breakdown, current frontier, acceptance criteria, blockers, decisions, validation, and
completion evidence for one top-level task — so the project survives a lost session and
continuity holds across sessions, machines, and harness switches.

The tree is not a second roadmap. `ROADMAP.md` states the high-level direction; a task tree
owns the disciplined execution of one lane of it.

## Code-change doctrine (binding, non-negotiable)

**It is strictly forbidden to make any code change unless it is first tracked/owned by a
task-tree leaf.** "Code change" = any edit to Rust sources, `Cargo.toml`/build scripts,
generated artifacts, or anything altering behavior. Before touching code, a leaf must exist
that owns the change (create/extend a tree, or add a leaf). The leaf — its goal, acceptance,
verification, and commit — is the unit of traceability. Enforced by
`scripts/check_task_tree_ownership.sh`.

## Leaf lifecycle (statuses)

`proposed` → `pending` → `active`/`in_progress` → `done`. A leaf is `done` only when its
acceptance criteria are met, verification is recorded, and it is committed via `COMMIT.md`.
Mark `blocked` (with the blocker named) rather than leaving a stalled leaf `active`.

## The pivot rule

**Do not pivot to a different task-tree while the repo is dirty.** The repo is
handoff-ready only when the tree is clean (no modified/untracked work except the task-tree
file itself). Finish the current leaf and get the repo clean before switching — even if
asked to pivot immediately. The guarantor of repo integrity holds this line.

## Commit traceability

Each slice uses a work-unit id in the commit subject (e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007`). When the
slice belongs to a leaf, the subject or first body line also names the leaf ID
(e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007 (leaf FEATURE-X.2): …`), so the slice id and the tree node coexist
on the same commit. One commit per completed leaf.

## Active Task Trees

The roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`, revision 2.0) is represented in full by the trees below. The
roadmap-unit → tree mapping and the F01–F30 fixture-ownership map live in
[`tasks/PROGRAM.md`](tasks/PROGRAM.md).

| Tree | Status | Frontier (next leaf) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`S0`](tasks/S0.md) | `active` | `S0.8` — the book's S0 chapter says three descriptions where the directory holds four, and says four later in the same chapter. F28's evidence is unaffected; the seven original leaves stay closed | repo-local |
| [`PROGRAM`](tasks/PROGRAM.md) | `active` | `PROGRAM.11` — **medium**, and **the frontier leaf**: the repository-boundary doctrine in **both** directions (`docs/decisions/decision_repository-boundary-read-only.md`). The rule was nowhere in the committed tree, which is how an *inbound* crossing got recorded backwards in a durable record; the outbound half is preventive, the inbound half fired once and was handled correctly. **`PROGRAM.21` is closed** (`2026-09-29`, `7c59b0b`): `TASK-ACCEPTANCE` is **leaf-scoped** — the owner comes from `TASK_ACCEPTANCE_LEAF` or the `(leaf X)` token in the pending message's subject through the `.doctrine/commit_message_file` seam, and the check **refuses** when it cannot tell, because falling back to the first checklist in the file *was* the defect. The obvious signal was priced before it was discarded: which leaf sections a commit's diff touch agrees with the commit subject on **1 of 7** real code commits. Nine `--self-test` arms, whose own first oracle scored **4 passes on `exit 127`** — reproduced deliberately as mutation B2 and promoted into `docs/knowledge/verify-the-mutation-applied.md`. Then `PROGRAM.18` (**nine** of eighteen registered controls carry no repeatable RED arm — the figure was ten until `.21` armed one, so `.18` re-runs its census rather than reusing it), and `PROGRAM.24` — the **mirror** of `BOOK-ANCHORS`, which nothing covers: does a capability the codebase has get described in the book? Filed on one measured instance, the `rt-analysis` crate named nowhere in `docs/book/` | repo-local |
| [`M1`](tasks/M1.md) | `active` | `M1.13.4.4` — the manifest: one machine-read declaration of the suite's roots, what each root proves, the version it conforms to and what is excluded, with both existing walks (`conformance.rs`, `reference.rs`) enumerating from it instead of each restating `docs/semantics` + `examples`. Two measured constraints on the design: the exclusion must be enforced by **path** and be **non-vacuous**, because `LS-002`'s frozen `evidence/system.eadl` is byte-identical to `examples/s0-heartbeat/system.eadl` (`b495ee70…`) so content identity is false in one direction on the shipped tree, and a pattern that matches nothing passes by excluding nothing; and **no count goes in the manifest**, because a figure in prose is a figure nothing re-derives — `.4.3` had just found two such figures live and false in the book. Then `.4.5` (the baseline instrument, which must **enumerate** its constructs: the reference carries **6** machine-read tables, not the **5** `M1.13` recorded). **`M1.13.4.3` is closed**: the one empty literal category — `decimal literals : 0` against 194 integers and 13 strings — is closed by a case whose subject *is* the rational, `(period 12.5 ms)`, an 80 Hz loop no integer millisecond can spell, and §1's row for `12.5` was **demanded by the coverage leg** rather than added by hand. ⛔ The census of surfaces that change moved found two live false figures in `docs/book/src/checking.md`: "holds **25** worked cases", true at `6df022f` and false for **71 commits**, and a per-verdict table of 5 / 10 / 5 / 4 / 1 against a measured 11 / 7 / 5 / 4 / 2 — three of five rows wrong — both corrected to the measurement **and** gated by a leg comparing prose to walk. **`M1.13.4.2` is closed**: all **62** shipped descriptions state `(eadl-version eadl/1)`, the 13 frozen evidence files untouched, so §8 rule 2's justifying population went from a false sentence to a census (**13 of 75**) held by a leg. **`M1.13.4.1` is closed**: §8's rule had a **third** consumer — the kind registry, a production defect that answered `tool-failure` for everything — now one accessor, `language_version::declarations()`. **512 passed / 0 failed** over 37 suites. Then `M1.13.5` (the freeze gate), `.25`, `.26`, `.10`, `.21`, `.22` | repo-local |
| [`API`](tasks/API.md) | `active` | `API.1` — **measure** whether the engine compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, as a tier step in the shape of the existing `no-std-build`. Seeded `2026-09-28` from the director's ruling and `ROADMAP.md` §10.4: one declared engine API with a wasm binding and an **MCP server** any agent can drive, controlling an instance **post-build only** with both builds excluded. Then `API.2` (state and gate the no-subprocess invariant, which §10.4's safety argument rests on and which is currently written down nowhere). `API.3`–`API.7` are sequenced behind `M1.13`'s freeze and do **not** displace it | repo-local |
| [`M0`](tasks/M0.md) | `done` | — all seven leaves closed; F27 green | repo-local |
| [`M2`](tasks/M2.md) | `active` | `M2.8.2` — the release is **pinned** (`M2.8.1`, QEMU 11.1.1), so write the device-tree fixture the §3.2 agreement check compares against: `DEVICE_TREE_FIXTURE` names a file that does not exist, and no eADL description of the target exists either. Then `M2.6`; `M2.8.3` is sequenced after `M1.13` | repo-local |
| [`M3`](tasks/M3.md) | `pending` | `M3.1` — candidate enumeration and substitutability | repo-local |
| [`M4`](tasks/M4.md) | `pending` | `M4.1` — the typed runtime/build plan | repo-local |
| [`M5`](tasks/M5.md) | `blocked` | — **no board procured** (`M0.5`, 2026-09-13) | repo-local |
| [`M6`](tasks/M6.md) | `pending` | `M6.1` — three materially different systems | repo-local |
| [`M7`](tasks/M7.md) | `pending` | `M7.4` — the F01–F30 mandatory-case audit | repo-local |
| [`BOOTSTRAP`](tasks/BOOTSTRAP.md) | `done` | — | repo-local |

## Keeping this index true

This table is a **pointer**, and the trees are the source. It is updated in the same commit as
any leaf that changes a tree's status or frontier. A stale index is worse than no index: it is
the file a resuming session reads first, and it is the one place a wrong "next action" costs a
whole session's direction.
