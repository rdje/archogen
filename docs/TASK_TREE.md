# Task-Tree Workflow

This document defines the repo-local task-tree workflow. A step-by-step setup guide is in
[TASK_TREE_README.md](TASK_TREE_README.md). Individual trees live under
[`tasks/`](tasks/); the leaf template is [`tasks/TEMPLATE.md`](tasks/TEMPLATE.md).

## Purpose

Use a task tree when a top-level task is too broad to finish safely as one signoff-quality
slice, or when it is expected to discover subtasks over time. The tree owns the recursive
breakdown, current frontier, acceptance criteria, blockers, decisions, validation, and
completion evidence for one top-level task — so the project survives a lost session and
continuity holds across sessions, machines, and harness switches.

The tree is not a second roadmap. `ROADMAP.md` states the high-level direction; a task tree
owns the disciplined execution of one lane of it.

## Code-change doctrine (binding, non-negotiable)

**It is strictly forbidden to make any code change unless it is first tracked/owned by a
task-tree leaf.** "Code change" = any edit to Rust sources, `Cargo.toml`/build scripts,
generated artifacts, or anything altering behavior. Before touching code, a leaf must exist
that owns the change (create/extend a tree, or add a leaf). The leaf — its goal, acceptance,
verification, and commit — is the unit of traceability. Enforced by
`scripts/check_task_tree_ownership.sh`.

## Leaf lifecycle (statuses)

`proposed` → `pending` → `active`/`in_progress` → `done`. A leaf is `done` only when its
acceptance criteria are met, verification is recorded, and it is committed via `COMMIT.md`.
Mark `blocked` (with the blocker named) rather than leaving a stalled leaf `active`.

## The pivot rule

**Do not pivot to a different task-tree while the repo is dirty.** The repo is
handoff-ready only when the tree is clean (no modified/untracked work except the task-tree
file itself). Finish the current leaf and get the repo clean before switching — even if
asked to pivot immediately. The guarantor of repo integrity holds this line.

## Commit traceability

Each slice uses a work-unit id in the commit subject (e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007`). When the
slice belongs to a leaf, the subject or first body line also names the leaf ID
(e.g. `MYPROJ-AREA-0007 (leaf FEATURE-X.2): …`), so the slice id and the tree node coexist
on the same commit. One commit per completed leaf.

## Active Task Trees

The roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`, revision 2.0) is represented in full by the trees below. The
roadmap-unit → tree mapping and the F01–F30 fixture-ownership map live in
[`tasks/PROGRAM.md`](tasks/PROGRAM.md).

| Tree | Status | Frontier (next leaf) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`S0`](tasks/S0.md) | `active` | `S0.8` — the book's S0 chapter says three descriptions where the directory holds four, and says four later in the same chapter. F28's evidence is unaffected; the seven original leaves stay closed | repo-local |
| [`PROGRAM`](tasks/PROGRAM.md) | `active` | `PROGRAM.11` — **medium**, and **the frontier leaf**: the repository-boundary doctrine in **both** directions (`docs/decisions/decision_repository-boundary-read-only.md`). The rule was nowhere in the committed tree, which is how an *inbound* crossing got recorded backwards in a durable record; the outbound half is preventive, the inbound half fired once and was handled correctly. **`PROGRAM.21` is closed** (`2026-09-29`, `7c59b0b`): `TASK-ACCEPTANCE` is **leaf-scoped** — the owner comes from `TASK_ACCEPTANCE_LEAF` or the `(leaf X)` token in the pending message's subject through the `.doctrine/commit_message_file` seam, and the check **refuses** when it cannot tell, because falling back to the first checklist in the file *was* the defect. The obvious signal was priced before it was discarded: which leaf sections a commit's diff touch agrees with the commit subject on **1 of 7** real code commits. Nine `--self-test` arms, whose own first oracle scored **4 passes on `exit 127`** — reproduced deliberately as mutation B2 and promoted into `docs/knowledge/verify-the-mutation-applied.md`. Then `PROGRAM.18` (**nine** of eighteen registered controls carry no repeatable RED arm — the figure was ten until `.21` armed one, so `.18` re-runs its census rather than reusing it), and `PROGRAM.24` — the **mirror** of `BOOK-ANCHORS`, which nothing covers: does a capability the codebase has get described in the book? Filed on one measured instance, the `rt-analysis` crate named nowhere in `docs/book/` | repo-local |
| [`M1`](tasks/M1.md) | `active` | `M1.13.4.2` — the retrofit: all **62** suite descriptions state `(eadl-version eadl/1)`, which is what makes §8 rule 2's justifying sentence *true*. That rule names the population relying on the absence-denotes rule as "the frozen LinkedSpec evidence under `docs/feedback/` … which nothing in `crates/` reads", and measured, **62 live files rely on it too** (`grep -l eadl-version` over the 75 → 0) — so the small-and-frozen population the rule's acceptability rests on does not exist yet, and the rule's stated expiry would otherwise be a 62-file migration performed *under* the freeze gate. `M1.13.4.1` cleared what blocked it: ⛔ **a production defect**, the kind registry refusing the identifier as `schema-not-a-kind` and taking the whole registry with it, so `archogen` answered `tool-failure` for every description — the **third** consumer of §8's rule, which `is_identifier`'s own doc comment predicted and no description-level test could reach. Found by writing the identifier into all 62 files and running everything (**45 failed / 447 passed over 9 suites**, 36 of them that one consumer), and fixed with one accessor, `language_version::declarations()`, serving the loader, the schema pass, `module.rs`'s count and the field `archogen check` counts when it prints `(8 declaration(s))` — a line the book publishes. What `.2` still owes: the **9** legs that treat every top-level form as a declaration (`corpus.rs`'s "exactly one", `f27`'s `forms[0]` seed), and every book transcript whose line numbers the insertion moves — 14 line-numbered transcript lines over 8 chapters that nothing re-derives, `PROGRAM.20`'s seventh shape. Then `.4.3` (the one empty literal category: `decimal literals : 0` against 194 integers and 13 strings), `.4.4` (the manifest — one declared population, both walks read it, the exclusion enforced by **path** and non-vacuous, because `LS-002`'s frozen evidence copy is byte-identical to `examples/s0-heartbeat/system.eadl` so content identity is false in one direction on the shipped tree), `.4.5` (the baseline instrument, which must **enumerate** its constructs — M-P measured the "five machine-read tables" `M1.13` recorded as already **six**). Then `M1.13.5` (the freeze gate), `.25`, `.26`, `.10`, `.21`, `.22` | repo-local |
| [`API`](tasks/API.md) | `active` | `API.1` — **measure** whether the engine compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, as a tier step in the shape of the existing `no-std-build`. Seeded `2026-09-28` from the director's ruling and `ROADMAP.md` §10.4: one declared engine API with a wasm binding and an **MCP server** any agent can drive, controlling an instance **post-build only** with both builds excluded. Then `API.2` (state and gate the no-subprocess invariant, which §10.4's safety argument rests on and which is currently written down nowhere). `API.3`–`API.7` are sequenced behind `M1.13`'s freeze and do **not** displace it | repo-local |
| [`M0`](tasks/M0.md) | `done` | — all seven leaves closed; F27 green | repo-local |
| [`M2`](tasks/M2.md) | `active` | `M2.8.2` — the release is **pinned** (`M2.8.1`, QEMU 11.1.1), so write the device-tree fixture the §3.2 agreement check compares against: `DEVICE_TREE_FIXTURE` names a file that does not exist, and no eADL description of the target exists either. Then `M2.6`; `M2.8.3` is sequenced after `M1.13` | repo-local |
| [`M3`](tasks/M3.md) | `pending` | `M3.1` — candidate enumeration and substitutability | repo-local |
| [`M4`](tasks/M4.md) | `pending` | `M4.1` — the typed runtime/build plan | repo-local |
| [`M5`](tasks/M5.md) | `blocked` | — **no board procured** (`M0.5`, 2026-09-13) | repo-local |
| [`M6`](tasks/M6.md) | `pending` | `M6.1` — three materially different systems | repo-local |
| [`M7`](tasks/M7.md) | `pending` | `M7.4` — the F01–F30 mandatory-case audit | repo-local |
| [`BOOTSTRAP`](tasks/BOOTSTRAP.md) | `done` | — | repo-local |

## Keeping this index true

This table is a **pointer**, and the trees are the source. It is updated in the same commit as
any leaf that changes a tree's status or frontier. A stale index is worse than no index: it is
the file a resuming session reads first, and it is the one place a wrong "next action" costs a
whole session's direction.
