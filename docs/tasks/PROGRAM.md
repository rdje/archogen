# PROGRAM: program spine — roadmap ownership, workspace, tiers, and the book

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `PROGRAM`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: workstream F — engineering operations (`ROADMAP.md` §11, §14, §15)
- Created: `2026-09-13`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Own the cross-cutting engineering substrate that every milestone tree depends on: the
conversion of `ROADMAP.md` into task-trees, the Rust workspace and crate boundaries, the
tiered verification story, the `xtask` runner, the versioning/ledger discipline, and the
mdBook that is the director's window into the project.

## Non-Goals

- This tree does not implement eADL semantics, engine realization, analysis, or generation.
  Those belong to `M0`–`M7` and `S0`.
- This tree does not restate the roadmap. `ROADMAP.md` remains the direction; the trees own
  the disciplined execution of it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every roadmap milestone, work package, and mandatory fixture (F01–F30) is owned by a leaf
  in some tree, and the mapping is discoverable from `docs/TASK_TREE.md`.
- The workspace layout matches the responsibility boundaries in `ROADMAP.md` §4.2, with
  crates created only when a real consumer justifies the split.
- `make check` and `make gate` stay green; the tiered verification story of §14.3 is
  implemented as named, runnable commands.
- The mdBook describes what the code actually does, with no drift.

## Task Tree

- ID: `PROGRAM`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: own the program spine
  Children: `PROGRAM.1` (+ `PROGRAM.1.1`) … `PROGRAM.8`

- ID: `PROGRAM.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: convert `ROADMAP.md` into the milestone task-tree set and register it.
  Acceptance: a tree exists for `M0`, `S0`, `M1`–`M7`; every F01–F30 fixture and every §18
  work package names an owning tree/leaf; `docs/TASK_TREE.md` lists them all.
  Verification: `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` green; coverage table in this file.
  Commit: `ARCHOGEN-PROGRAM-0002`

- ID: `PROGRAM.1.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: declare this project's code-path seam so the neutral `TASK-ACCEPTANCE` default stops
  classifying `docs/book/src/**` as a code change.
  Acceptance: the book page no longer matches the code-path set; the gate goes red→green with
  no edit to any spine check.
  Verification: see the acceptance checklist below.
  Commit: `ARCHOGEN-PROGRAM-0002`

  ### Acceptance Checklist (enforced by `TASK-ACCEPTANCE`)

  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — the built-in default in `scripts/check_task_acceptance.sh`
    is `default_code_re='(^|/)(crates|src|scripts)/|\.(rs|sh)$|(^|/)Makefile$'`; its `(^|/)src/`
    arm matches a `src` segment at ANY depth, and this repository's mdBook sources live under
    `docs/book/src/`. Measured on this commit's staging set:
    `git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '(^|/)(crates|src|scripts)/|\.(rs|sh)$|(^|/)Makefile$'`
    → `docs/book/src/introduction.md`, `rc=0`. With one "code" file staged, the check then
    demanded a ticked checklist on all ten staged trees.
  - [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — before: `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` on the staged set printed
    `TASK-ACCEPTANCE: docs/tasks/S0.md has no 'ROOT CAUSE' box …` (30 such lines, ten trees × three
    boxes) and `=== 1 doctrine breach(es) — commit blocked ===`. After declaring
    `.doctrine/code_paths.txt`: the same command prints `=== all doctrines green ===`, `rc=0`,
    and `git diff --cached --name-only | grep -Ef .doctrine/code_paths.txt` matches nothing.
  - [x] **NO REGRESSION** — the seam narrows nothing that is really code: `\.(rs|sh)$` still
    covers every Rust and shell source wherever it lives, and `crates/`, `scripts/`, `xtask/`,
    `catalog/`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` and `rust-toolchain.toml` are named
    explicitly. Full enforcer re-run: `=== all doctrines green ===` (13 checks), `rc=0`.
  - [x] **FIX** — added `.doctrine/code_paths.txt`, the seam `.doctrine/README.md` documents.
    No spine check was edited.
  - [x] **LOCKSTEP** — recorded here and in `DEV_NOTES.md`; the seam file carries its own
    measured rationale so the next reader does not have to rediscover it.

- ID: `PROGRAM.2`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: establish the workspace skeleton and crate boundaries actually needed by S0/M1,
  replacing the bedrock starter crate with the `osgen` CLI shell.
  Acceptance: `cargo test --all` green; `osgen --help` lists the §10.2 command surface as
  implemented-or-unimplemented, with unimplemented commands exiting with a clear diagnostic.
  Verification: see the acceptance checklist below.
  Commit: `ARCHOGEN-PROGRAM-0003`

  ### Acceptance Checklist (enforced by `TASK-ACCEPTANCE`)

  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — the workspace still held only the template's starter
    crate, so the project had no entry point and the §10.2 interface target existed nowhere in
    code. Measured at the parent commit: `git ls-tree --name-only HEAD crates/` → `crates/app`
    (one crate); `git grep -c 'bin name = "osgen"' HEAD -- crates/` → no match, `grep rc=1`;
    `git show HEAD:crates/app/src/main.rs | grep -n 'println!'` →
    `7:    println!("bedrock: replace this crate with your project — start from ROADMAP.md.");`.
    WHERE: `crates/app/src/main.rs:7` — the only executable behavior in the repository was a
    template placeholder.
  - [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — after: `cargo run --quiet --bin osgen -- --help` prints all
    seven §10.2 commands with their owning leaves and the eleven-row exit-code table,
    `exit=0`; `cargo run --quiet --bin osgen -- check examples/periodic-three/system.eadl
    --profile rt-static-up-v1` prints
    `osgen: unimplemented: \`osgen check\` is not implemented yet` with
    `hint: … tracked by task-tree leaf M1.8`, `exit=20`. Before, the same binary name did not
    resolve at all (evidence B above, `grep rc=1`).
  - [x] **NO REGRESSION** — `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → `fmt rc=0`; `cargo clippy
    --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` → `Finished \`dev\` profile`, no warnings;
    `cargo test --all` → `test result: ok. 28 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0
    filtered out`; `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` → `=== all doctrines green ===`, `rc=0`;
    `mdbook build docs/book` → `INFO HTML book written to`.
  - [x] **FIX** — removed `crates/app`; added `crates/osgen-cli` (lib `osgen_cli` + bin
    `osgen`) with the §10.2 surface declared once as data in `src/spec.rs`, a hand-written
    parser in `src/cli.rs`, and the §5.5 outcome vocabulary with stable exit codes in
    `src/status.rs`. Zero external dependencies.
  - [x] **LOCKSTEP** — `docs/book/src/cli.md` (new chapter) and `SUMMARY.md`;
    `docs/decisions/decision_zero-dependency-engine-core.md` + its index row;
    `knowledge-map/subsystems.md`; `MEMORY.md`; `LIVE_STATUS.md`; `CHANGELOG.md`.

- ID: `PROGRAM.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: implement the tiered verification runner (`xtask`) for the §14.3 tiers
  (focused / integration / extended / hardware / assurance), including the CI-policy split
  between per-commit focused checks and the pre-push full gate.
  Acceptance: each tier is a named command; a skipped or unavailable required tool is
  reported as skipped, never as a pass.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `PROGRAM.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: stand up the mdBook structure that mirrors the program: mission, boundary, profile,
  language, engine, analysis, generation, evidence, CLI.
  Acceptance: `make book` builds; every chapter that describes behavior points at the code or
  fixture that implements it.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `PROGRAM.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: implement the dependency/evidence ledger of §15 and §19 as a tracked, checkable
  record (external source versions, retrieval dates, scope, limitations, revalidation
  triggers).
  Acceptance: every external source claim in the book and decisions resolves to a ledger row.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `PROGRAM.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: implement semantic versioning separation (§15) — language/profile semantics, engine
  implementation, catalog entries, model versions, evidence formats — as machine-checked
  version records with a compatibility corpus.
  Acceptance: a locked description retains its meaning across an engine upgrade; F25 has a
  home.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `PROGRAM.8`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: resolve the cross-tree lockstep friction in `TASK-ACCEPTANCE` — the check requires a
  complete acceptance checklist from **every** staged `docs/tasks/*.md`, not from the leaf that
  owns the staged code, so propagating a blocker into a second tree in the same commit as code
  is refused.
  Acceptance: either a declared seam that lets a commit name its owning leaf, or a documented
  convention with a gate that enforces it; the fix must not reopen the cross-file evidence
  leakage the check was hardened against, and must not be a local edit to the portable check.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

  ### ROUTING EVIDENCE

  - **Does it reproduce outside this project?** Yes. Nothing in the refusal is
    archogen-specific: it fires for any repository using this spine whenever one commit lands
    code owned by tree A and a documentation edit in tree B. Measured here on
    `ARCHOGEN-M0-0009`: `docs/tasks/M5.md` was staged carrying only a blocker note, and the
    check reported `docs/tasks/M5.md has no 'ROOT CAUSE' box in its acceptance checklist`
    ×3 with `=== 1 doctrine breach(es) — commit blocked ===`, while `docs/tasks/M0.md` — the
    tree that actually owns the change — carried a complete, evidenced checklist.
  - **What was measured:** the refusal is a property of the check's *file scope*, not of the
    content. Unstaging `docs/tasks/M5.md` and changing nothing else returns
    `=== all doctrines green ===`.
  - **What would make this routing wrong:** if the strictness is deliberate — i.e. if requiring
    every touched tree to justify itself is the intended cost of the cross-file hardening
    described in the check's own header. That is plausible, and it is why the acceptance above
    forbids any fix that reopens the leakage. The correct first output of this leaf may be an
    upstream report rather than a change.
  - **Interim convention, in use from 2026-09-13:** split the commit. Code and its owning tree
    land together; a documentation edit to another tree lands as its own docs-only commit. See
    `docs/knowledge/cross-tree-lockstep-and-commit-scope.md`.

- ID: `PROGRAM.7`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: project-specific doctrine checks (`scripts/check_doctrines.project.sh`) that encode
  this program's own invariants — most importantly that no implementation content leaks into
  eADL fixtures, and that assurance wording cannot overstate evidence.
  Acceptance: each check fails on a seeded violation and passes on the clean tree.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `M0.1` | `pending` | the boundary decision is what `M0.2`, F27, and every schema cite |
| 2 | `M0.4` | `pending` | the profile bounds what S0 and M1 may accept |
| 3 | `PROGRAM.3` | `pending` | the tier runner formalizes what `make check` does informally |

`PROGRAM` yields the frontier to `M0` here: the CLI shell is the last thing the milestone
trees needed from the substrate, and `PROGRAM.3`–`PROGRAM.7` all describe machinery whose
shape depends on decisions `M0` has not made yet.

## Decisions

- `2026-09-13`: one tree per roadmap milestone, plus this `PROGRAM` tree for the
  cross-cutting substrate. Rationale: a milestone is the roadmap's own unit of exit-gate
  evidence, so a tree per milestone makes the frontier and the gate the same object.
- `2026-09-13`: the engine carries no external Rust dependencies
  (`docs/decisions/decision_zero-dependency-engine-core.md`). §4.4 makes every dependency
  shared between generator and checker a reviewable trust event, §10.3 requires locked
  offline builds, and §5.5 makes diagnostic wording part of the user contract.
- `2026-09-13`: the §10.2 command surface is declared **once, as data**
  (`crates/osgen-cli/src/spec.rs`); help text is rendered from it and the parser validates
  against it, so documented and accepted options cannot diverge.
- `2026-09-13`: `docs/book/src/` is NOT a code path here. The neutral `TASK-ACCEPTANCE`
  default treats any `src/` segment as Rust source; the project seam
  `.doctrine/code_paths.txt` states this repository's real shape instead of editing the
  portable check. Found by the gate refusing this tree's own first commit (`PROGRAM.1.1`).
- `2026-09-13`: crates are created when a consumer needs them, per `ROADMAP.md` §4.2, not
  up front as eleven empty shells. The responsibility names in §4.2 are the naming
  convention for when each split happens.

## Open Questions

- None blocking the frontier.

## Blockers

- None.
